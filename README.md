# Object-Recognition-using-huskylens

HuskyLens is an AI-powered vision sensor that can perform object detection, face recognition, line tracking, and other image processing tasks. It is based on the Kendryte K210 chip and offers built-in algorithms for quick AI integration into embedded projects.
I will provides an overview of using HuskyLens for object detection and integrating it with microcontrollers such as Arduino

# Feature 
- AI Vision Sensor: Detects objects, faces, colors, and more.
- Built-in Machine Learning: No need for external training; it learns objects via a single press.
- Serial/I2C Communication: Easily integrates with microcontrollers.
- Touchscreen Interface: Simple UI for learning objects.
- Customizable: Supports firmware updates for enhancements.

# How use 
HuskyLens provides multiple AI modes. For object detection, ensure the device is set to Object Recognition Mode:
1- Press the Function Button to enter the menu.
2- Select Object Recognition mode.
3- Long press the Learning Button to save an object.

Hint : I download some library needed from github
